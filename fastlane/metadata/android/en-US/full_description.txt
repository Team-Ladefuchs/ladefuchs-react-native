HOW MUCH IS THE ELECTRICITY FOR YOUR EV CAR?
Find the cheapest charging plan fast as lightning.

With just one finger swipe, Ladefuchs shows you the cheapest charging plan at the charging point.

Not more, not less.

The app is free. However, the little Ladefuchs (Chargefox) is always happy like a young badger about food donations.

He always cheeps a bit then.

The app is targeted to the German EV charging market and in German language only currently.
